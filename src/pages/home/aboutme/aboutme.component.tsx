      I've worked with a variety of organizations - from start-ups to
      established businesses and government agency in different parts of the
      world. I love working with people! It's just more fun that way. Especially
      when creating products and services that helps businesses solve their
      problems through efficient software development.

      Just between you and me 😉 this is something a little philosophical, you
      know what keeps me going? The promise of a product that I've worked on
      improving businesses, workflow or even people's quality of life in
      whatever way. 🚀
